# Rank up

## The leaderboard command

The `!top` command can be used to see the leaderboard of the DraftBot players, by points count. She also displays your ranking, and the page at which you are. The players will be displayed 15 by 15, showing their name, their status, their points count, and their level.

### Tricks

It is possible to see a specific page of the leaderboard, by typing `!top <page number>`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In the example above you don't need to write &lt;&gt;
{% endhint %}

### Others leaderboards

The topweek command is `!topweek <page number>`.
