# Classes

Since the [**2.10**](https://history.draftbot.com/draftbot-v2/2.1.0) version of DraftBot, you can choose a class for your player once you have reached the **level 4**. The default class for every player is **Soldier**.

### How to choose a class ?

The choice of class depends on your level, there are 4 different ranks of classes :

* Rank 1 : Between level 4 and 16
* Rank 2 : Between level 16 and 32
* Rank 3 : Between level 32 and 48
* Rank 4 : Above level 48

There are a total of 18 classes available in the game

Once you are at level 4, you can use the `!class` command to change your class.

Changing classes costs money. You can change as many times as you want.

### Class statistics

The `!classstats` command has been added since version 2.1.1 of DraftBot to know the different statistics of the classes.
