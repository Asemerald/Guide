### Figths types

#### Normal fight

A normal fight can be started with the `!fight` command. You can add a `@user` option just after the command, to specify a user to fight. If you are not the creator of the fight, and if you don't have any state alteration, you can click on the âœ… emoji in reaction. In these type of fights, the winner earns points, and the defeated player looses some.

#### Friendly fights

The friendly fights works the same as the normal fights, no one is loosing or earning points at the end. To start one you can run the `!friendlyfight` command.

### Progress of a fight

The fight is a turn by turn system. At every turn you will have to choose between 6 options :

âš”  **Simple attack**: An attack that has normal chances to succeed.

ðŸ—¡  **Fast attack**: An attack that has good chanced of succeeding if you are faster than your enemy.

ðŸ”¨  **Heavy attack**: the chances of succeeding are low, but it makes much damages.

ðŸ’£  **Ultimate attack**: an attack on 2 tuns, that is efficient if you have a lower speed than your enemy. She removes around 2/3 of your opponent's life.

ðŸ§¨  **Bull attack**: this attack does damages to all fighters, useful if you have more defenses than you ennemy.

ðŸš€ **Speed**: Get faster. If your speed is about your opponent's, your chance of succeeding an attack are higher except for the ultimate attack. The most the action is used, the less it will be efficient.
