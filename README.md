## What is DraftBot ?

DraftBot is a discord bot developed by [@BastLast](https://github.com/BastLast) that allows you to live a textual adventure. 

The story takes place in a medieval world and the player controls an adventurer who must win a competition organized by the king in order to access the hand of the princess. To reach his goal, he must travel, collect points and face many dangers. The game takes place in real time, and the player must regularly ask for "reports" from the character he controls. During these reports, the character may be led to be advised by the player through a choice system using discord reactions. Each choice leads the character to beneficial or not consequences. During his adventure, the character will be led to be injured, to collect different equipment...
